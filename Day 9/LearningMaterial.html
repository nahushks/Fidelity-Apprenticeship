        <dt>Introduction</dt>
        <dd>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a versatile and powerful language widely used in software development, web applications, and mobile applications.</dd>
        <dd>Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and is now owned by Oracle Corporation. It follows the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on any platform that supports Java without the need for recompilation.</dd>
        <dd>Java's syntax is similar to C and C++, making it easy for programmers to learn if they are familiar with those languages. It is also known for its robustness, portability, security features, and performance, which is why it is used by many large-scale systems around the world.</dd>
        
        <dt>Why Java?</dt>
        <dd class="reasons">Java is platform-independent, secure, and robust.</dd>
        
        <dt>Overview of Topics</dt>
        <dd id="description01">In this course, you will learn about Object-Oriented Programming, Java Basics, and more.</dd>
        <dd id="description07">We also cover advanced topics such as multithreading, collections, and I/O streams.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p title="Additional Info">Java is widely used in web development, mobile applications, and enterprise systems.</p>
    
    <p>Key Concepts to Remember: <em>Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation</em>.</p>
